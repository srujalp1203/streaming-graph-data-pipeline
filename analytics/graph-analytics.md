## Graph Analytics

### PageRank
PageRank was applied to identify high-importance locations based on inbound trip
connectivity and weighted relationships.

### Breadth-First Search (BFS)
BFS was used to compute traversal paths between locations in the transportation graph,
supporting reachability and path analysis.
